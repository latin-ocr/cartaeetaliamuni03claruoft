with the advowson ot Miehelstow,’ and yields them up to John Trevelyan. Among the witnesses are
John Butler, Matthew Cradock, and Maurice Butler.

From the above statements it may, perhaps, be inferi-ed that Sir Walter Herbert, who was second son of
Wffliam the great Earl of Pembroke¹ availed himself of Duchess Alice’s shadow of a claim, through the
enfeoffment of her father, to enter on the lands, intending, since Trevelyan would not sell, to secure them
to the duchess, who was not likely to care for them, and thence obtain them for himself. Herbert died
childless before 1488.

John Trevelyan, who so perseveringly fought for, and successfully established, his right, died in 1493,
leaving

XIV. John Trevelyan, then aged thirty years and upwards, and who, or his father, seems to have
disposed of the estate, which a few years later appears in the possession of the Earl of Worcester. The
Trevelyan muniments have evidently been so careiully preserved that it is not improbable that the
date and particulars ot* the sale may be found among them.

Of the Castle of Wrenchester, or, as the place is now called, Wrinston, ‘etiam periere ruinoe ’ς but the
name oi the family who held it in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries is preserved in the adjacent seat
of ert-yr-Raleigh (now known as Court-yr-Alla), where the Raleighs probably resided when the circum-
stances of the country rendered the confinement of a castle unnecessary; and which may have been, in
later times, the residence of their agent or steward.

of Dinas Powis casule, part of the reputed heritage of Ela de Reigny, the walls of the principal
enclosure remain. They retain no trace of ornament, nor even of ashlar3 but are probably of the twelfth
century, and the work of Sir Milo or his immediate progenitors. The name and position of the fortress
support the tradition of its having been a Welsh stronghold, where, not improbably, J estyn and his father
may have resided. It stands upon and crowns a knoll of rock in the mouth of Combe George, and besides
being inconveniently small for a wealthy knight oi the thirteenth century, was scarcely tenable against
the improved military engines of that age, for which reasons it was probably abandoned for Wrinston.

The mauors of Wrinston in Wenvoe and Michaelston-le-Pit are contiguous, forming one compact estate,
and were holden under the lordship of Dinas Powis : bnt it is singular that this lordship or cantred, held
by Ela and her husband, should not have been held, with the eastle, by the later Raleighs and Trevelyans.
At a somewhat subsequent period Dinas Powis Iordshjp appears as divided, one moiety being in the Crown,
and the other in the Herberts.

The two mauors of Wrinston and Michaelston, as well as that of Llaucarvan, of which Trevelyan
seems to have recovered possession in 1488, were, together with West Orchard manor, the subject of a
family settlement (lOth November, 11 Oharles Ι.) on the marriage of Edward Lord Herbert, Earl of
Glamorgan, with Lady Katherine Dormer, in which these, with many other manors elsewhere, were settled
on Lord Herbert for life, with remainder to Henry, his eldest son, These, no doubt, were either sold to, or
exchanged with, the Herberts by Trevelyan ; and thence passed, on the marriage of the Pembroke heiress
with Sir Oharles Somerset, into the latter family.

What is enumerated with the above three as ‘ Llantwit Manor,' is, no doubt, West Llantwit or Llautwit-
Raleigh, called also Abbot's Llantwit3 and not Boverton manor in Llantwit, which has always been
annexed to the lordship of Glamorgan; and was with it sold or granted to Sir William Hei-bert, ancestor
of the bastard branch of that family.

Llantwit-Raleigh probably was held on lease under Tewkesbury Abbey, and from its chief lord derived
its name of Abbot's Llantwit‚ for 12th June, 15 Henry VIH., Edward Stradling applied to purch-ase it as
parcel of the possessions oi the dissolved monastery of Tewkesbury, and with the application there existe,
in the Augumentation Office, a confirmation (23 Elizabeth) of the maner by Sir william Cecil, knight,
