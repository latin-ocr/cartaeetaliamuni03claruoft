This reeords the second transfer of Leckwith, now from Laurence de Sandford to Philip Basset.

Philip Basset, who witnesses the Chai-ter of Nicholas, and by that of Lawrence de Sandford has the
maner of Lequid or Leckwith, near Cardiff, was a considerable person.

Alan Basset, of Wycombe, who died 17 Henry ΠΙ.. was father of-l, Gilbert, whose only son died
young. 2, Warine, who was in rebellion in Wales with Earl Richard Mareschal. and was killed in an
attaek on Cardiff Castle in 1233, aud buried at Ll-mdaff. He left no issue. 3, Fulke, Deau of York.
Aruhbishop of Dublin, and Bishop of London, who inherited, and also died childless, {3 Hemy ΠΙ.
4, Philip, fourth Baron Basset οξ w5combe. In 1258 he was one of the twelve barons elected by the
combined king’s and bai-ons* party, aud afterwards of the twenty-four appointed to reform the realm. In
1261 he was made justiciary of England. and in 1264 one of those whose lande were wasted by the
barons for their adhesion to the King. In 1264 he was at the battle of the Lewes. and had a narrow
escape, for so long as he could stand to fight he refused quar-ter. In 1266 he was one of the twelve elected
by the ⁶ Dictum de Kenilwortln' to classify the insurgents according to their guilt. In the following year
he was the mediator between the King and the Earl of Gloucester. In 1271 he was again on the side of
modemion, and agrees to the restoration of their lands to the attainted barons. He died late in October.
56 Henry 111. (12Τ1), aud was buried at Stanley in Wilts. His character is thus forcibly summed up in
the Osney Chronicle: ‘Eodem anno, quarto kalendas Novembris, obiit dominus Philippus Basset. vii·
magni consilii et nobilis, et super omnia fidelis, strenuus in armis, et multum diligens Anglicos et terrae
communitatem et super omnia religiosorum promovens negotia . . . . cujus animae propicietur Deus:

He married, 1, Helewise, daughter of John Gray of Eaton; 2, Ela, daughter of william Longespee,
Earl of Salisbury, and widow of Thomas Earl of Wurwick. She died 26 Edward 1. By the first he left
an only daughter. Alina Basset, who was twenty-six at her father’s death, and therefore born 1245. She
married first, Hugh le Despenser, who superseded or alternated with her father as justiciary ; and finally
was slain, on De Montfort's side, at Evesham in 1255. They had a son, Hugh, known as Hugh le
Deepenser the elder, and beheaded at Bristol in 13263 and a daughter. Alina married secondly Roget
Bigod, fourth Earl of Norfolk and Earl MareschaL who died 35 Edward I. He was son oi Hugh the
justiciary; and thus, as Foss observes. she was the daughter of one chief justiciary, the wife of a
second, and the daughter-in-law of a third. Alina seems to have died 9 Edward 1.‚ when an inquisition
was taken upon her lauds 3 but it was 18 Edward 1. before Bigod married again.

Who Alan Basset married is not known, perhaps a Sandford, for, from the annal: of Tewfflbury, Fulk,
when insta-ned Archbishop of Dublin in 1257, is called ⁴ Fulco Basset vel de Sandford! The coincidence
is at least singular.

It is at present uncertain whether these Bassets of W ycombe were of the same bmnch with the Bnesets
of St. Essary in Glamorgan and of walton-Cardiff, otherwise Walton-Basset iu Glouoeetershire, whose
descendants, long settled at Beaupre, Llantrithyd, Treguff, Fishwear, Llanveithen, and Bonvileston, still
remain, in the male line, at the latter place.
