Pagnn or Payn de Turbervile, οἱ Coyty, son οἱ Richard and grandson of Gilbert, had charge of the
Honour of Glamorgnn, the accounts for which during his charge were rendered by Gwennian, his widow,
and are in the Pipe Roll, 10 Ed. 11.. 1316-17. He probably died 1³16, since he was alive at the partition of
Enrl Gilbert de Clare‘s estates and held Coyty and Llanharry. Payn was succeeded by Gilbert hie eon
and heir.

Matilda, who married John Alger‚ was daughter of Hamund de Turbervile. and sister of william.
According to the Welsh Pedigrees, Sir Richard had a second son, Wilcock. father of Hamund, and there-
fore, gmndsim of Willinm and Matilda Alget, so that Matilda was the grandniece of Payn. This is
perfectly possible for Wilcock may have married as early as 1270.

Robert de Cantelow was probably Cantelope of cantelupeston or Cantleston, at the mouth of the
Ogmore.
