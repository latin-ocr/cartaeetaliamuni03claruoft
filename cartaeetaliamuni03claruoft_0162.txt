Cecilia was a daughte) aud co-heir of William de Fortibus, probably a kinsman to the Earl of
Albemarle of those names, ir. whose barony he held land. Her mother, Matilda, was a daughter of
William, Earl Ferrars, by hie second wife Sybil, a daughter of William Mareschal the elder, Earl of
Pembroke, and co-heir oi her brother, the last earl. Matilda was a co—heir of her mother. In this way,
from her mother, Cecilin inherited a share of the Mareschal lande at Sturminster Mareschal, Doreet ; west
Kington, Wilts ; Wodemersh, Suri-ey ς Ballingham, Cambridge3 and Weiweton aud Widcombe, Somerset;
and probably, with the last mentioned, came the manor which gave rise to the contest. Matilda de
Feri-ers married secondly william de Kyme, and this is the name she bears iu various inquisitione and
returns as to the inheritance of her children.

Willizun de Godmarston or Godmanston was witness to an inquisition 15 Edward I. He was probably
one of a branch of the line of Hastings who derived that name from a maner in Essex or Dorset.
Dychelnestone has not been identified. Robert de Draycote died 21 Edward 1.‚ and William de Cruket
was aged 30 years in the 35 Edward 1.‚ so that he must have been a boyat the time of the abduction. All
were Somerset landowners, probably holding landa under Cecilia or the Beauchamps.

The heir, whose wardship was in question, was Thomas, son and heir of John de Hanwey or Hawy οὶ
Combe-Hawy or Combe-Hay, a parish and maner about three miles south-west oi Bath, and lord of the
maner οἱ St. Donate, in Glamorgan. St. Donate was held by military tenure by the service of oue
knight's see, How Comlre-Hawy was held does not appear, nor indeed is it certain that the wardship was
claimed on account of that maner, though this is highly probable. The priory referred to must have been
Briweton or Bruton, the priore of which held a carucate of land in Combe-Hay, granted by the Cantelupes.

The nature of the plea is set forth in the opening paragraph of the record, commeucing with the words
‘de placito,' to the conclusion of the paragraph, evidently derived from the on'ginal writ. The parties
attached were Cecilia, widow of John de Beauchamp, Peter de Bosco, Robert de Beauchamp, parson of
Stoke-under-Hamden, a family living 3 William de Godmarston of Dychelneston3 Robert de Draycote and
william de Cruket·

Next follows ibe name and lineage ot the heir3 his property, his wardship, aud ‘maritagiumss or right of
giving him in man-lage vested in the Earl; his being found at Brinton, and the statement of the Earl’s
absence in attendancae. upon the King in Wales.

Then comes the abduction by ior-ce and against the Earl's will, and commencing with ‘et quod vioe·
comess,v the instructions under which the Sheriff of Somerset, taking with him the Coroner and aKnight of
approved fidelizy, was to go zo Brinton, where the ward had been lodged for securim with his nui-ses, nt
