claimant.

lVilliarn de Brens, however, sets up iu defence the Royal grant of all the land of Gower, with the
appartenances, by King John to his great grandfather, Willium, for the service of oue knight, and pleads
absolute right to the disputet] possessions.

The cause is set down for trial in Easter Term, and ou the appointed day the parties appear, aud the
claimant seeks to invalidate the defence, (i.) as far as the Castle of Swansea is concerned, because of the
omission of the word casae in the original granu (ii.) because the land was granted in Normandy under
circumstances of need and compulsion, and seisin thereof was not gmnted3 and (iiii) alleges that the
defendant is a stt-anger not recognised in the grant. In support of all this he propounds the following
pedigree :—

aneum: or BRmJS.

6. Wmmm,
the defendant.

He further alleges that the defendant succeeded by agreement between his father John and Reginald
his father'e uncle, and not by hereditary descent.

The defendant replies (i.) that the castle, although not specially named in the gmnt, is one of the
appurtenances thereof3 (ii.) that he is not a strunger, but a direct descendant of his great grandfather
William, to whom the second william succeeded, und then in turn John son of the second William and
father of the defendant. During this J ohn's minority the custody of h'm heritage was delivered by King
John to t'ne uncle mles, theu Birhop of Hereford ; on the death of Giles the other uncle Reginam intruded
himself into the wardship, but afterwards restored i't to the said John.

The Eurl's rejoinder is that the second william de Breus never had seisiu of the land, and that J ohn'e
succession was the result of a compact with Reginuld.

The case is set down for Michaelmas Term. But on the day fixed for hearing, William de Breus is
eezoigned, that is, fined, because he does not put in :m appearance, and it goes over to Hilary Term. On
the appointed day the Earl appears in person, and William de Breus is represented by his attorneys, hut
the hearing is defen-ed to Easter Term. The Earl again appears in person on the day fixed, but the
attorneys of william de Brenn are eesoigned, and once more the case goes over to the next Term. On the
appointed day in Michaelmas Terrn the partica appear, and a day is agreed upon during the ensuing
