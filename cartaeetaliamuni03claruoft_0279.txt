The family of de 13 Bere held lands in Devou and Gloucestershire when their residence was at
somnam, but some of them acquired land in Gower and Glamorgan, where ¹ Robertus filius Ber ¹
witnessed the foundation charter of Neatb Ahbey in about 1129. As he signs first he was, probably‚a
man οὶ some importance. In Gower they held land in Knolston and Weobly of de Braose, and at the
latter place had a considerable Oastle. In Glamorgan they held by marriage a moiety of Marcross, and
their land there was inherited by Bassett of Beaupre. Sir John de la Bere (died 1380) married Agnes, one
of the sisters and co-heiresses of the last Turberville of Coity. Riehard de la Bere was sheriff 5 Henry V.
And in Gower, Sir Roget, temp. Edward HL, was of Cheriton aud Llangenydd. His grand-daughter and
heiress married Oradock, who thus obtained Cheriton.

John, eldest son of Sir John by Agnes Turberville, gave a quit—claim οἱ a Burgage in the Castle Bailey
of Swansea, in 1384, and died 1409-10, seized of Weobly. His brother, and probably heir, was Thomas, aged
90 in 1411, and his co-heiresses were his sisters Elizabeth‚ who married Sir John St. John of Foumon, and
Margaret (Susan 7) who married Sir Elias Bassett.

Their pedigree would appear somewhat as follows 2——
