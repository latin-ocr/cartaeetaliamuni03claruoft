‘ ÷ s’ THOME DE sc'o DONAT’J

Nothing has hitherto been known ot any family bearing St. Donats as a sumame. Certainly they never
held the minor, which from Fitzhamon's Conquest for some centuries was held by the De Hayweys
of Comana-wey, Co. Somerset, and through their heiress by the Stradlings.

It appoers, however, that William de Sancto Donato was Presbyter of St. Donats in 1201 [CCLXV1.],
and as Win. de Sancto Donato witnessed a Charier in the time of Bishop Henry,and one granted by
'rhomam Gramns without date [CCX. CLXV.]‚aud a william de Sancto Donato was Abbot ot* Nmth,
and accepted a donation οἱ an acre of land to that Abbey from Sir Edu-ard Stradling in 1341.

Also there is a grant by John Bareth without date as witnessed by Thomas, Chaplain of Kenfeg, and
son of william de Sancto Donato, and who also in 1264 occurs as a donor of land in Kenfig to Margum
[DCCIX., DCXXVJ, AJso a Baldwin de Sancto Donato occurs in a grant by Henry de Sutthuu to
Mar-gam. temp. Edward Ι. [ΒΟΟΒΧΙῩ]

william was probably simply designated from his benefice, but Thomas and Baldwin may have borne
St. Donate as a family name.
