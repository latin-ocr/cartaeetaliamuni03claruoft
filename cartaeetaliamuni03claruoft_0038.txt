lesu 2, Simon; 3,Joan; and 4, Maud, eventunl coheirs. Mami had the Welsh estates, which, on het

lx. Simon de Raleigh of Nettlecombe and Wrenchester, on whose death, childless, the estates seem
to have been parted between his two sistem. He married, first, Joan —, who died 14 Henry V1.; and

Simon died 12th March, 18 Henry VI. (1441-2), and J 0311 died before 1455.

cnrvan. She married Sir John de Whellesborough, or Waloehorow, or Whalesborough, in Marham-Church,
cor Cotnwall. They were 3 considemble Cornish family, and possessed Llancarfe, Treisdor, Lamelwyn, and

XII. Elizabeth Whellesborough, heiress of the Oornish, Someiset, aud Welsh estates. She married
John Trevelyan of Trevelyan and Basil iu St. Cleather, co. Cornwall, who bore yules, a horse arqm‚armed
or, rising οιιι οἱ the sea, party per sess, wavy, azur-e and m: In consequence of this marriage the Treve-
lyans settled at Nettlecombe‚ aud became also Glamorganshire landowners de jure, though not, as wm
appear, ior some time dc facto. The marriage settlement is dated London, loth J uly, 1452. It does not
include the Welsh property, which possibly was then vested in Catherine. It appears from the Trevelyan
papers, printed by the Camden Society‚ that the Duke of Suffolk, who, by descent. from Ismayn Hamps,
was of kin to the Whellesboroughs, had got possession of their Welsh property. In 1463 John Trevelyan
addressed the Du'se, pointing out that his wife, Elizabeth, was the true owner of the mauors of Mighelstone
and its advowson, ot Lancarvau, Luntewyte‚ ‘and Wrygstone, with their appurteuances: which had
always been in their blood until lately, when Alice Chaucer, the Duke's mother, by the management of
william, late Lord Herbert, entered upon the lauds contrary to right : and he prayed the Duke to consider
his own estate and the poverty ot Thomas Whellesborough and his heirs, though of the Duke's blood, and
to appoint a day to have the truth examined into, and the lands restored.

At the same time Trevelyan moved the King, who also 111 1463 wrote to the Duke, stating that he
understood that Trevelyan had long made suit to him no longer to withhold his wife's inheritanoe in
Wales, entailed upon her and her heirs by fine, as the heir of Sir John and Simon Raleigh, ‘which entail
resteth to our exchequer at Gai-diff! The King adds that the Duke's mother entered on the lands 011 the
plea that her father, Thomas Chaueer, was enieoffed of them, whereas Trevelyan can shew that. he was
enteoffed only as trustee.

The letter from Edward IV. seems 1ο have produced no effect. Trevelyan (then Sir John), twenty-five
years later, in 1488, addressed himself to Hem-y vn, relating how he had been despoiled of his landa in
the time οἱ J asper Duke of Bedtord, the King's uncle, by Sir Walter Herbert, now deceased ς who, because
the mauors lay near his own lande, and he could not obtain them by fair means, used his great power, and
feigning a title, entered upon them wrongfully, and left them to his widow, Lady Anne, now living, and a
sister ot Edward stafford,‘Duke of Buckingham. Sir John adds that he cannot prevail against such power,
and prays the King's interfereuce.

The effect oi this further application was to produce a release from John Duke of Snffolk in the same
year, in which he quits au claim to the ‘mauors of Michelstow, Wrynchester, Lanearvan, and Lantwit,
