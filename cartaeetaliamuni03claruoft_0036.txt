The family οἱ Dc Reigny, very many of whose reem-ds occur among these Charters, is said to have
sprung from Renuee in Bretagne. The members possessed Culm-Reyny in Devon and xewtou-Reyuy in
Onmberlmd, and a branch settled early in Glamorgan, where they had a ca=t1e‚etc. Wrenchester or
Wrinston is in Wenvoe, to which they added by frequent purchases a considerable area of land, some
probabl5 acquired x'rorn the Umframvines by a marriage with the Furneaux, their co-heirS. They also
held the manor of Colweneston or Colwinston, within which Blakeberege seems to have lain, and whence
they gave fifteen acres to Margum, which were held, probably in see-farm, by the Colwinstou family.
There is no good De Reigny pedigree [see DCXLV. for what can be dedueed from these Charters]‚ but
Roget witne÷sed a De Londres Chai-ter about 1131, and is probably buried at Ewenny. Walter witnessed
anorher Charter in 1147, and J oan seemav to have been eventnally the heiress of the family and to have
married Simon de Raleigh of Nettlecombe. Their descendants held Wrenchester ἔοι* six generations, when
about the middle of the fifteeuth century Joan de Baleigh carried it to her husband Sir John de Wheuee-
borough. of Whelloeborough in Coruwall. Their grand-daughter and heiress, Elizabeth Wheuesborough‚
married John Tre-celfam, and their son was of Nettlecomtae, and, after a vexatione law-suit, of Wrenchester.
The Raleighs gave name to Coun Raleigh, now ert-yr-Alla, and to the manor of Llamwit-Raleigh‚ or
Abbots Llamwit.

Llantwiz and other parts of the property were purchazed by Sir William Herbem and desoeuded to the
Marquis oi Worcesten when the Parliamem granted them to the soldiers of Horton's brigade after the
battle of St. Pagans. They were next purchased from both Lord worcester and the brigade by Colonel
Jeme-⁴, οἱ ἴυηωου, and long remained iu that family.
