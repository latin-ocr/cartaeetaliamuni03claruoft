The following extract from the pedigree of Carne of Nash will form a convenient introduction to the
aooompanying oharters.

Howell Carne, who probably migrated from Monmonthshire to Nash, and who lived in the reign οξ
Henry VI.. married Theobalda, or Tybote, a daughter and co-heir of John J oel, or Giles (probably a oedet
of Joelston, or Gileston), and the reputed heiress of Nash. Their son,

John Carne, of Nasb, married Cioely, daughter of Sir John Poyntz, Knt.; or, by other aceounts,
Elizabeffl, daughter of Howell ap Thomas ap Gwylim ap J enkin Her-bert, of Perthir, co. Mon„ the Herbert
anoestor. They had Howell, Roget, and Richard.

Howell Carne, of Rasin, living temp. Henry vm„ married Cecil, daughter of William Kemeys of
Newport. They had Richard, Sir Edward (whence Carne of Ewenny), and others,

Richard Carne, of Nash, married, l, a daughter of Sir Rice Mansell, of Oxwichg and 2, J oan, daughter
and heir of Edward ap John Daldeyn by a daughter of William Levis. By one or the other wife, or by
both, he had many children, and among them John, of Nash, sheriff, 1561 ς and Blanehe, who married
Griffith Grant, of Sigginston, her cousin,

The five Dalden Charters mention william de Daldene, 1290, who had property in Cardiff; Edward
Daldeyn, of Penarth, in 1432, also with property in Gai-diff ; John Daldeyn, elerk, 1440, with property in,
Llanishen ; and David Daldeyn, the elder, evidently a near relation. Also John Daldeyn, of Glamorgan,
gent„ and David hie brother, occur in 14493 and Edward Daldeyn, their deceased father. They had
property iu Cardiff town, and in the lordship of Llandaff. John Daldeyn, of London, in l451,has property
in the same. He is son of Edward Daldeyn, gent„ and his brothers and sister-s are David, Katherine,
william, J ohn, Isabella‚ and Reymbrand Daldeyu.

It thus appears that the Daldeyns were owners of property, and probably residente, in the oounty‚ for
at least one hundred and sixty-one years, or from 1290 to 1451. They do not, however, appear as land-
owners in the spenser Survey, nor substantively in the county pedigrees. In that of Carne they are
called of Penmark, evidently au error ior Penarth. The Golden Grave Book gives four descents of the
Daldeyns 3 John, of West Place in Penaith, father of Edward, father of Jenkyn, who married a daughter
of David Kemeys of Began, and had Joan Daldeyn, who married Richard Carne. As the chartam
now given only range from Edward 1. to Henry VL, they do not prove the match with Carne, which
occurred in the reign of Henry VIJJ. or later3 but their preservation with the Carne muniments is strong
presumptive evidence of the connexion.

The names in the above Oharter of 1290 belong mainly to Car-diff. They are Thomas Aleyn,
niel-md de Caneton or &anton (a village near Cardiff), Richard Elys, Thomas Long, John Lude, william
Mareseal, Walter de Querou (probably Oke or Okes), and John de Raath or Roath, near Can-diff. Reee
Meyrick (p. 50) mentions this name, and marries Aliae, daughter οἱ David Roth, to Jenkyn ap Adam ap
Cynaelthwy ap Herbert. Ajso John Odyn and Roger Poleter are prepositi. Henry odiu appears in the
County Extent in 1262.
