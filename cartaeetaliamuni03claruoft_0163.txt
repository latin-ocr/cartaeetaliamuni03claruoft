the Priory, by his mother, Joan de Eanwey ; and was to take him in charge until the conflictiug claims
to his wardship should be deeided upon by a proper tribunal. It was from the Sheriff’s cnstody that the
youth is alleged to have been abdueted, for which the Earl claims 5:1‚000 damages.

1 am reminded by a learned friend that this procedure agrees in substance with the form of pleadings in
a suit given by Fitz Herbert (De Natura Bavium, p. 329) upon an action for trespass in abducting a ward
personaliy, with a claim of damages, thus differing from a wi-it of right,in which the actual wardship was
to be recovered.

What follows are the subsequent pleadingS, plea, replication, and rejoinder, in regular succession. The
defense is severed, Robert Beauchamp and others simply denying the abduction 3 and Cecilia and others
pleading specially what appears to be a traverse of the actual abduction, and alleging that the ward, being
at the time out of the Earl’s seizin, Cecilia, as entitled to his wardship, took possession of him, because his
nurses intended carrying him away. A mse in the year-books shows this fact to be necessary to the
defence, because even the legitimate guardian could not jnstify a forcible taking of the ward out of the
custody οὶ another claimant of the wardship. She states that John de Hanwey, the father oi the heir
Thomas, was in ward for five years to her husband and herself ; by them was married. and died in their
homage, the Earl raising no objection, though at the time of full age. Peter [de Bosco] seems to be
erroneounly entered in the record as sharing Cecilia‘s plea. He joined Robert Beauchamp.

In the subsequent proceedings the Earl seems to abandon the question of mvishmentf and to discuss the
legal claim to the wardship, which he rests upon the heir's tenure of St. Donats, stating that Earl Richard,
his father, was seized of the body of Thomas, grandsire (‘avus ¹) of the heir; on which account he was
'unpleaded by Cecilia's father, who died during the pleading. Also J ohn. the heir's father, at the age οἱ
sixteen was married by Henry de Montfort to his kinswoman : but because this was without licence, John,
when 110 beoetm of age, fined to the Earl for two hundred marks. This abandonment of an important part
of the plea was possibly permissible under the rather loose legal proceedings of the day. No doubt the
Earl had a legal right to the wardship of the heir of the maner of St. Donats during his nonage3 but
then Cecilia had the same right with respect to the heir's maner iu Somerset.

The admitted facts seem to be, that the Earl's father had the custody of the ward’s ancestor, and that a
suit as to his right to it had been commenced by Cecilia's father, William de Fortibus, against the then
Earl, in which the Earl's actual seizin was admitted, though its legality was devied. william died pending
the snit ς and the ward married without a licence from his lon-d, which breach of feuda] law he repaired, on
coming of age, by a fine of two hundred marks. The Earl evidently regarded this as uu admission of his
rights, and, as 110 doubt it was, of the fact that Thomas de Hawy and his ancestors held. and had held, of
the Earl and his ancestors.

The pedigree of the Hau-y family is obscure. Comb-Hay is entered in Domesday as ¹Comb‚' when its
tenant, under Bishop odo of Rapax, was · Sanson.' Whether he was ancestor of the subsequent lords
is uncertain ; but one os the earliest was Sampson de Allweia, one of the tenants of the Earl of Gloucester
in Glamorgan3 and Robert, second son, witnessed Umfraville and Bonville charters in Glamorgau in
1217 and 1230. Another of their mauors was Over Compton, or Compton-Hawy, in Dorset, on the Yeo,
close to the Somerset border. This in Doumday is called ·‘ Conetone‚’ and was held in capite by the Abbot
oi Sherborne. The Hawy family were for centuries tenants under the Abbey. In Kirby's Quen. 1284-86,
