whose possemions, with the consent οἰ their over-lords‚ gradually gravitated to the Abbey, and so only are
remembered‚ until, at last, the whole Lordship was absorbed by the monksz, and thus, soon after the disso-
lution, hemme the property of Sir Rice Mansel, by whose heir-general it is still held.

J estyn had many children, ot whom caradoc was the eldest, and had Avan, aud seems to have built the
eastle. Boru probably not later thau 1078, he seems to have married ει daughter of Prinne Rhys,
Gwladys, it may bey Owen, a younger son, was owner of a greyhound celebrated for his fidelity to his
master, and which, at Owen's death, was given by William, Earl of Glouoester, to Hem-y 11. Gamdoc
may haye died about 1148.

Murgan ab caradoc was his son and successor. ‘ Morgan Arglwydd,'' he was called by the Welsh, pro-
bably in eompliment to his maternal ancestry. He did homage to Henry 11„ at Glmwester, in 1175, and
in 1188, escorted Aschbishop Baldwine and Giraldus Cambrensis across the treacherous marshes of Avan
and, Neath. His parentage aud possession oi Avan are established by a Chai-ter of King John in 1205.
Among his donations to Margam and Neath are mentioned lands between the N edd and the Tawe. 11: is
probable he married the heiress of Kilvae. Various Charters mention Leyson, Murgan, Owen, and
Cradoc as his sons² and there seem to have been others. Murgan, taken prisoner by William, Earl of
Gloucester, purchased his freedom by the substitution of Canaythur as a hostage, but soon afterwards
broke out again into rebellion, on which the Earl put out Canaythur's eye-⁵³. Canathur or Alaythur was a
considerable landowner, and probably near οἱ kin to Murgan, who mitigated his breach of saith by the
gift of lands at Rossowlin or Resolven on the Nedd. He seems also to have acquired property in Gower.
Morgan probably died 1207-8. His son and successor was—

Leison ab Morgan, probably of age 1204, when he commanded 200 Welshmeu in the service of King
John. He died childless, and was succeeded by brother, distinguished as Morgan Gam. He also was a
donor to Margan. His great seul bears an armed knight on hor-seback. with the legend ‘Sigillum Morgani
Gam? He was probably born about 1140. He sided with the Welsh against the Earl of Gloneester,
who, in 1227, sent him prisoner to ‘E‘uglana On giving hostages for his future behaviour he was
liber-steni, but careless of his hostage, he bumt the town ot Kenfig. He died 1240, and was buried
at Margam. He added to his Gower property by grauts from John de Braose. Who his wife was
'm uncertain. His successor was Sir Leison ab Murgan who was in possession in 1246. He died
childleaQ and was followed by his next brother, Mon-gan Vaehan, who was in possession in 1249, and at
the death of Earl Richard de Clare ir. 1263-4, was returned as holding half a commot in Welshery by
the payment at death of a hei-iot of a horse and arms. By some pedigrees his wife is called the
heiress of Kilvae, by others. Mam, the eventual heiress of Walter de Sully, but there is little
certainty for either.

Leison ab Morgan, his son and successor, adopted the summme of d’Avene. He also is said to have
married the Sully heiress. On the death of the last Earl of Glouoester he is returned as holding a
commote by serjeantry, which in the partition of the estates is set down as equal to three knights’
fees. In the rebellion by Llewelyn Bren he supported the muse of order.
