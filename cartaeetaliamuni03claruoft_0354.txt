§²3) Llaugiwc, Langawi, Langewydd is a parish of above 12,500 acres, in the Hundred of Llangyfelach,
aud on the North and East abuts upon the Counties of Garmai-then and Brecknock. 1⁴„ was held in 1³17
by the Abbot of Margum, and was included in the division of the Lordship allotted 1ο Alienor de Clare
and her husband. “

011 the division οἱ the De Clare estates between the sisters oi the last Earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
Wentllwch, and with it Νῶε-9011, fell to the share οἱ Margaret, the second sister, who married, as mentioned
above, Hugh de Audky, as her second husband, who was on her account created ΕΒΑ-1 of Gloucesterin 1337.
Their daughter and heir, Margaret, married Ralph Stafford, Earl stafford, so created 1351, and who died
1372, leaving Wentllwch and other estates to Hugh his son :md successor, who died at Rhodes 1386. His
son Thoms, the :ir-l Earl, died 1392. whose brother William, 4th Earl, died 1³95, leaving a third brother
Edam-d, {nh Earl, who died 1403, leaving a son Humphrcy, the 6111 Earl, who came of age in 1420, and
granted a Charter to Newport iu 1427.

As in the partition the whole of the Giamorgan estates fell to the elder sister, this schedule, though
containing a third part only oi the property, is complete as regards the Lordship of Glamorgan, and is
specmxy interesting as giving the names ot' all the teuuuts who held 111 capite of the Lord.
