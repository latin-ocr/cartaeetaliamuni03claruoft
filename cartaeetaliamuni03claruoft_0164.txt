two sisters of william, annts to John, and her great-aunt, a sister of (1) Richard and (2) John.
Pending the dispute, Earl Richard held Marcross as a manor in capite comitatus. This appears from the
Cal. δῶκά, ρ. 107 ; and is corroborated by a Glamorgan inquisition in 1262, in which Thomas de Haweye,

of the same value, which the heir of Richard le Bntiler ought to hold. Thomas, therefore, had become
custos of the manor, which is close to St. Donats ς and it looks as though he represented the elder bmnch
of the family, who, not being in office, retained their family name. As Marcross was acquired by the
younger bmuch. Thomas's name does not appear among its claimants.
