Kenefeg, so frequently mentioned iu the Ahbey Chal-tera, is Kenrig iu Pyle, the parish next south of
Margam, aud which reaches to the sea-shore. Much of it has long been covered up with ‹lrit't saud, but
under the Nonnans the village became a borongh town. and, though disfmnchised, still retains its ancient
Chartam-s. A slender fragment of its castle rises through the saud, and it is celebrated for its pool. It
was till recently a contributory parliamentary borough to Swansea, but this was solely in compliment.
to its former prosperity.

The Kenfig brook, often referred to as a bouudary of the Abbey franchise marval-ds, was probably the
ancient boundary of the contigimus pai-ish of Newtou or Newton Nottage. The course of the brool( may
have been somewhat altered by the drift. hut it still exists, and, percolating through the sauds. has a
channe! to J‘oiu the sea.
