The native authorities concur in giving to the Lords of Avan or Avene the foremost place among the
Glamorgan landowners of pure Welsh descent, their founder being the eldest son of J estyu, the last native
prince οἱ the Lordship, aud so continuing in the male line until their termination in an heiress late in the four-
teenth century. To them was allowed the Lordship of Avari Wallia, to be held by grand seijeanny, or rather,
per Barouiam, by the payment at death οἱ a heriot of a horse and arms⁷ and no other service. Though
Welsh leaders, and not infrequently iu 1000111011, they adopted many of the Norman customs, assumed
armorial bearings and armour, and are so represented on their great senls appended to their chmers, by
which they created and maintained their municipal borough of Avan Burgus at the mouth of the river
Avan7 and near to which 11115 their baronial castle, now entirely swept away. Their Lordship included
the parishes of Baglznn and Aberavan. and extended from the mid-stream os the Avuu westward to that of
the Neda river, with a long frent to the sea. Their power, however, was to some extent ειη-11011 by the
strong Caetle of Kenfig, built and held by the Chiex' Lotus, und of which the scanty ruins have been over-
wheltned by the blown §and uf that district. Upon their northern boundury was placed the Nurinan
Abbey of Margam, to which. nevertheless, the-v were liheml benefactors, :md in which they found a
'curying place. Within their boundaries were settled n considerable number οἱ small Welsh landowners.
