Win‘nm de Cantelo. or Cantelupe. hore a nume very widely known throughout the Welsh Mamhes3
bui the actual connection ox⁴ Une family of Gower and Cantssupesoon with the Bai-ons Cantilnpe and the
oenonized bishop of Hereford. has not been ascertained, although various circumstances, besides the
peculiarity os the name and arms. render the connection more than probable.

Sir william Cantilupe of Cantleston or Tremntlo castle, in Merthyr Mawr, is reputed ancestor of
william, El'ms, md william. three generations allied hy various ties with Dunstanville of Cornwau,
Umfravine, Vaughan, Butler, De Londres, and De Braose of Glamorgan and Gower. Robert de Cantelow
tested a Gower deed in 1304. and a Margam Charter (75 A* ⁴3) in 1308. The Welsh pedigrees deduce the
Lorth Cantilupe οἱ Abergavenny r'rom this ancestry : but this is exceedingly improbable, and the reverse
is more likely to be true. It seems certain that Czntleston. Nemora, and Cornellau, were conveyed
in marriage by Joan, the Cantelupe heffena, to Horton. whose gund-daughter, Jenet‚ daughter οἱ Jenkin
nonen, murried Bichard, and was mother of the well-known Sir mathew Cradoek of New Plane in
Swunsea. A fragment of the castle of the Camelupes. of the date of Edu-ard IL, stands on the horder of
the =and hills in Merthyr Mam, and still preserves the name ot* Cantleston.
