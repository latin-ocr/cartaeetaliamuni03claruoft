The introduction of the De Raleigh family into Glamorgan by the reputed marriage of Ela de Reigny,
the heiress of Wrenchester Castle, Michaelston-le-Pit, Llantwin and Llancarvan, with Simon de Raleigh‚
has already been mentioned under the former family. The Raleighs sprang from Raleigh by Barnataple,
and as retaiuers of the Earls Mareschal adopted their modified coat of “quies a bend fusilly arycnt‚' inetead
of their earlier bearing of ‘six crosses croselet.' ·

1. Hugh de Raleigh ot Raleigh received Nettlecombe from John Fitz Gilbert, Mareschal of England,

Edward ΠΙ. In 1368- 9 herr g,ranted as Sir John Raleigh of Nettlecombe, knighr, a Chaiter of all his tene-
ments in ι Wrenchelston in Wales ’ to John Hiwy& rector of Nettlecomhe : uo doubt aa a feoffee in trust
upon one of his marriages. He married—l, Maud, who died childless ς and ⁵2, Ismayn‚ daughter and coheiress
of Simon Hanaps of Gloucestershire, who died a widow, Sth September, 1420, having married, 2nd, Sir John
Borowash or Burghersh of Ewelme, co. Oxou, where he was born 1347« He died 'Met September, 1391.
